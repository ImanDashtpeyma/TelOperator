Routing of telephone calls
Some telephone operators have submitted their price lists including price per minute for different
phone number prefixes. The price lists look like this:
Operator A:
1 0.9
268 5.1
46 0.17
4620 0.0
468 0.15
4631 0.15
4673 0.9
46732 1.1
Operator B:
1 0.92
44 0.5
46 0.2
467 1.0
48 1.2
And so on...
The left column represents the telephone prefix (country + area code) and the right column
represents the operators price per minute for a number starting with that prefix. When several
prefixes match the same number, the longest one should be used. If you, for example, dial
+46-73-212345 you will have to pay $ 1.1/min with Operator A and $ 1.0/min with Operator B.
If a price list does not include a certain prefix you cannot use that operator to dial numbers
starting with that prefix. For example it is not possible to dial +44 numbers with operator A but it
is possible with Operator B.
The Goal
The goal with this exercise is to write a program that can handle any number of price lists
(operators) and then can calculate which operator that is cheapest for a certain number. You
can assume that each price list can have thousands of entries but they will all fit together in
memory.
Telephone numbers should be inputted in the same format as in price lists, for example
“68123456789”. The challenge is to find the cheapest operator for that number.
